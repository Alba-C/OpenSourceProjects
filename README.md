#### Project Scope
The Coding Boot Camp Pipeline Network Open Source Project seeks to leverage the awesome talents of new and expert coders to build a web based application that will:

1.  Help capture important and relevant information about its members work experience, programming knowledge, training, hidden talents and interests.
2.  Help connect students with graduates, mentees with mentors, job seekers with hiring managers, and entreprenuers with expert advisers.
3.  Help contributors gain valuable experience in the web development cycle (creating, scoping, architecting, coding, collaborating, and promoting) to further enhance their marketability as an prospective employee.

## <a name="Description"></a>Product Description</center>

The Coding Boot Camp Pipeline Network Open Source Project will build a web based application that handles a membership-based searchable database in order to foster valuable connections, creativity and collaborations.  The application allows users to connect with others for job opportunities, mentoring, and open source collaboration.  Users will be able to import their linkedIn profile and expand it into a more comprehensive profile to give members a deeper dive into their work experience, their education, their passions and interest, and their career aspirations.
